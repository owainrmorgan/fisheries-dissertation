Owain says he is interested in looking in detail at the size distributions in the stomach.
We discuss some aspects of this, in particular how for some families of distributions the
number distribution and the biomass distribution come from the same family, just with shifted
parameters. He will look into which of the well-known distributions have this property. We
discuss that it may be necessary to take into account that the stomach number distribution 
for a species will depend on other variables and how ignoring this will lead to wrong 
predictions for the stomach biomass distribution. 

I suggest that for his project Owain could also try to make the link between the stomach 
content and the predation rates. I share with him a document where I wrote down some ideas 
how to do that.

We briefly discuss the preliminary report. Owain suggests to write about kernel density
estimation, which I agree will give him a good opportunity to exhibit his mathematical
writing skills. I ask him to also include a description of some background material on 
a topic related to his project with lots of references to the literature.
